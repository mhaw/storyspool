**Summary:**
Significant progress has been made on the StorySpool MVP. The core application is now successfully deploying and running on Cloud Run, with key infrastructure and security configurations hardened. Client-side authentication via Google Sign-In is now fully functional, allowing users to log in and interact with the application.

**Key Accomplishments (Since Last Report/Recent Focus):**

*   **Cloud Run Deployment & Stability:**
    *   Resolved critical startup failures related to environment variable conflicts and Docker image build processes.
    *   Hardened Cloud Run runtime service account with least-privilege IAM roles.
    *   Normalized Cloud Run service configuration for improved reliability.
*   **Client-Side Authentication (Google Sign-In):**
    *   Implemented and integrated client-side JavaScript (`auth.js`) to handle Firebase initialization, Google Sign-In/Sign-Out flows, and dynamic UI updates.
    *   Successfully tested Google Sign-In, confirming users can now authenticate.
*   **Core Application Functionality:**
    *   Personalized "My Articles" page for logged-in users.

    *   Improved UI responsiveness for article lists across devices.
    *   Redesigned article actions for better user experience.
    *   Introduced a new landing page for anonymous users.
*   **Security & Performance:**
    *   Enabled Content Security Policy (CSP) in production via Flask-Talisman.
    *   Implemented long-term caching for static assets in production.
    *   Adressed proxy-related headers and cookie settings.
*   **Development & Testing Infrastructure:**
    *   Fixed numerous test suite issues, ensuring a more stable testing environment.
    *   Updated Firestore security rules to enforce authentication.
    *   Refactored templates and routing for clarity and maintainability.

**Current Status:**
The StorySpool MVP has achieved a functional state where users can successfully sign in via Google and access their personalized article pages. The core infrastructure is stable, secure, and deployable.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **User Feedback & Iteration:** Gather initial user feedback on the core sign-in and article management experience.
2.  **Article Submission & Processing:** Focus on refining the article submission process, ensuring robust background processing (TTS, extraction) and error handling.
3.  **Podcast Player Integration:** Explore options for direct integration with podcast players or providing clear instructions for users to add their RSS feeds.
4.  **Monitoring & Logging:** Enhance application monitoring and logging for better operational visibility.
